# SetSolverWithFineTunedYOLO
A program to win at Set with Friends!

## Demo
A video demo of the model completing a solo game of Set can be found in the VideoDemoSetSolver.mov file.

## Instructions
Run main.py and then quickly switch over to a fullscreen tab with a Set with Friends (https://setwithfriends.com/) game running.
This program will then automatically detect the Set cards on the board, determine which of the detected cards make a set,
and then click on the cards in quick succession. This process will repeat indefinitely, so terminate the program after
the game has been completed. The program is currently configured for the M2 Macbook Air with a 2560 Ã— 1664 resolution. 

## Paper
A paper detailing the training and testing of the model, as well as experimental analysis can be found in
the Playing_Set_Online_with_YOLOv8_Based_Image_Detection_Fine_Tuned_on_Synthetic_Data.pdf file.
